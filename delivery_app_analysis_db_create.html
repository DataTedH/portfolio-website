<h1>Creating a Data-Driven Dashboard for Gig Work: A Database Design Case Study</h1>

<p>As a gig worker, tracking the offers and deliveries you make across different platforms like DoorDash and Uber Eats can be a challenging task. This challenge becomes more pronounced when you want to analyze your earnings, work efficiency, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). In this article, I'll walk you through the design of a database that I created to capture and analyze data from my gig work. This star schema database design provides a robust structure for data analysis and visualization.</p>

<h2>A Star Schema Approach</h2>

<p>The database is designed as a star schema, a popular approach for data warehouse modeling. The central part of this structure is the 'fact' table, surrounded by several 'dimension' tables. The fact table records quantitative data about each offer received, while the dimension tables provide additional context.</p>

<h2>The Fact Table: Offer</h2>

<p>The heart of this database is the Offer table. Each record in the table represents an individual offer, capturing details such as the platform the offer originated from, the shift during which the offer was received, the timestamp of the offer, its acceptance status, estimated delivery time, estimated earnings, distance, and the number of items in the order.</p>

<h2>Dimension Tables: Providing Context</h2>

<p>Several dimension tables provide more granular details about each offer:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Platform</strong>: This table stores information about the gig work platforms being used. Each platform, such as Uber Eats or DoorDash, is assigned a unique ID and is recorded with its name.</li>
    <li><strong>Shift</strong>: This table documents each work shift with a unique ID, start time, and end time.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong>: Each unique location, defined by latitude and longitude coordinates, gets its own record in this table. Locations can be associated with pickups, drop-offs, and stores.</li>
    <li><strong>Store and Franchise</strong>: These tables help break down the source of orders. Each store, identified by a unique ID, is linked to a franchise and a location. The Franchise table stores the names of different franchises, like McDonald's or Burger King.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: This table documents the details of each completed delivery. It includes data such as the actual delivery time, the earnings from the delivery, the tip received, and timestamps for arrival and departure at pickup and drop-off locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing Relationships: Junction Tables</h2>

<p>The OfferDelivery and OfferPickup tables are junction tables. They manage the many-to-many relationships between offers and deliveries, and offers and pickup locations, respectively. These tables store combinations of IDs from the Offer, Delivery, and Location tables.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This database design allows for comprehensive analysis of gig work. Even without explicit FOREIGN KEY declarations (due to restrictions of the database provider), the relationships between tables are implicit in the design. This structure enables the joining of tables together in queries to perform in-depth analysis and visualization of earnings, efficiency, and other key performance indicators, providing valuable insights into the gig work experience.</p>
